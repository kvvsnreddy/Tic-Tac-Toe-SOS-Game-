## 🎯 How to Play

1️⃣ The game is played on a 3x3 grid.  
2️⃣ Player 1 places "S", and Player 2 places "O".  
3️⃣ Players take turns entering the row and column where they want to place their symbol.  
4️⃣ After each move, the game checks if the player has formed "SOS" in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).  
5️⃣ If a player forms "SOS", they win! If the board fills up without a winner, it's a draw.

### Why This `README` Stands Out:

1. **Emojis**:
   - Adds visual appeal and makes the content more engaging.

2. **ASCII Art**:
   - A creative touch to grab attention and make the project memorable.

3. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Includes challenges and calls-to-action to engage users.

4. **Clear Structure**:
   - Organized into sections with clear headings and concise descriptions.

5. **Screenshots**:
   - Visual proof of the game in action (replace `screenshots/gameplay.png` with an actual screenshot).

6. **Professional Yet Fun Tone**:
   - Balances professionalism with creativity to appeal to both developers and casual users.

### Adding the Creative `README.md` to Your Repository:

1. Create a file named `README.md` in the root directory of your project.
2. Copy and paste the above content into the file.
3. Customize placeholders like `your-username`, `your-email@example.com`, and the ASCII art to match your style.
4. Add a real screenshot of your game in the `screenshots/` directory and update the path in the `README.md`.
5. Commit the file:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add creative README file"
   git push origin main
